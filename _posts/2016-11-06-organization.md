# Three**Sixty** Supports editing the organization hierarchy

Now you can edit the organization hierarchy within Three**Sixty** Performance Review and relate the users to this hierarchy. This feature will be expanded in later releases to provide reporting that rolls up from the lowest level of the hierarchy all the way to the top giving company executive the 360 degree view that they require.
